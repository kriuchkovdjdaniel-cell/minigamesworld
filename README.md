# MiniGameWorld

MiniGameWorld is a browser game collection with a Windows desktop installer wrapper.

## Web Version

Open the web app from the deployed site or GitHub Pages/Vercel deployment for this repo.

## Windows App

This repo includes a Tauri v2 wrapper that packages the current static web files into a Windows desktop app.

### Build Locally

Install Node.js 20+, Rust, and the Tauri prerequisites for Windows, then run:

```powershell
npm install
npm run build:desktop
```

The installers will be created under:

```text
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
```

### GitHub Release Build

Push a version tag to build installers with GitHub Actions:

```powershell
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

The workflow uploads `.msi` and `.exe` installers to the GitHub Release.

### Notes

MiniGameWorld uses Firebase and online features, so the desktop app still needs internet access for accounts, leaderboard, rooms, and online games.
